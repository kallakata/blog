Me & myself
======
Hi! I am **kallakata**.
This site serves as a mere hotpot of ideas, scribbled notes, interesting observations and other career and tech-related stuff. Nowadays I mostly focus on Platform Engineering topics, Linux administration, DevOps-y concepts and some programming to make my day-to-day life easier.
